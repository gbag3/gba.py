I decided to create a program that can act as a basic calculator using python. I created this project because I wanted to see how everything I have learned about python so far, can come together and create a program. This program took me a while to fully complete because I had many errors in my code. I eventually fixed the errors, but all of the errors showed me that I still have much to learn, and it helped deepen my understanding of how functions work. Overall I would say this project was very fun to make and I am very satisfied with the results.
