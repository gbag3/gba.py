I decided to create a program that can act as a basic calculator using python. I created this project because I wanted to see how everything I have learned about python so far, can come together and create a program. This program took me a while to fully complete because I had many errors in my code. I eventually fixed the errors, but all of the errors showed me that I still have much to learn, and it helped deepen my understanding of how functions work. Overall I would say this project was very fun to make and I am very satisfied with the results.  

I wanted to implement my already created calculator app into somewhere that it can be useful. I decided that I wanted to create a chatbot that can use a calculator feature, and answer some basic questions. This project was very difficult, and I made more than a couple errors, however I learned more then I ever thought I could. In order to successfully complete this calculator v.2/chatbot v.1 I had to use a variety of functions, lists, maps, and most importantly, strings. I really love how it works and I hope I can make it even better over time.
